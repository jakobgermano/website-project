    <p>Did you know that the blue whale is the biggest mammal on earth? Weighing in at about 200 tons as a full grown adult! 
      and can grown to around 100 feet long! The reason we call them blue whales is because naturally they are
    colored grey but when they dive deep into the ocean because of the water and the sunlight they appear to be a darker blue.
  They are also known as the loudest animal on the planet and live to about 90 years old!</p>
